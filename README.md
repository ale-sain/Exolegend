# üõ†Ô∏è **The ExoLegend Hackathon**

---

## **Introduction**  

In **February 2024**, I had the opportunity to participate in the **ExoLegend Hackathon** organized by **Exotec**. This event brought together teams from across the country to solve a strategic robotics challenge.  

The objective was to program a robot capable of navigating an ever-evolving maze to **capture and control territory** by painting sections in the team's color. The challenge, inspired by the game **Splatoon**, required teams to avoid bombs, navigate the maze, and compete directly against rival robots. Each match lasted **120 seconds**, with victory going to the team that controlled the most territory.

## **Project Overview**  

We had **72 hours** to design, code, and optimize our robot's behavior. The coding was done in **C++**.  

Our work was divided into key phases:  
- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: To navigate and prioritize unexplored territory.  
- **Game Strategy**: To counter enemy moves and maximize our team's score.  
- **Testing & Debugging**: Adapting to the constantly changing arena and optimizing our AI logic in real-time.  

We had support from **Exotec's R&D engineers**, which provided insight into real-world robotics and helped us refine our approach.

## **Challenges & Lessons Learned**  

Competing in **ExoLegend** was intense, with only **72 hours** to create a fully functional robotic AI. The most challenging part was adapting to the unpredictable **dynamic maze** and managing fatigue as the competition progressed. Our biggest lesson was the importance of **planning before coding**. More time spent on strategy earlier would have led to better results.  

Despite the challenges, the experience was extremely rewarding. I improved my ability to **manage high-pressure deadlines**, **develop adaptable algorithms**, and **collaborate effectively with a team**.
